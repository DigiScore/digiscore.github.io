<p>We investigate the transformation of the music score
    through computational technologies. Digital scores
    utilising computational technology and digital media
    are emerging worldwide as the next evolutionary stage
    in the concept of the music score. They are generating
    new music experiences, innovative compositional
    approaches, novel performance opportunities, and
    broader accessibility for a vast number of musicians
    and music cultures around the world. </p>
