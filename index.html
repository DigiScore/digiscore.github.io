We investigate the transformation of the music score through computational technologies. Digital scores utilising computational technology and digital media are emerging worldwide as the next evolutionary stage in the concept of the music score. They are generating new music experiences, innovative compositional approaches, novel performance opportunities, and broader accessibility for a vast number of musicians and music cultures around the world.
