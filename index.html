<p>We investigate the transformation of the music score</p>
<p>through computational technologies. Digital scores</p>
<p>utilising computational technology and digital media</p>
<p>are emerging worldwide as the next evolutionary stage</p>
<p>in the concept of the music score. They are generating</p>
<p>new music experiences, innovative compositional</p>
<p>approaches, novel performance opportunities, and</p>
<p>broader accessibility for a vast number of musicians</p>
<p>and music cultures around the world.</p>
