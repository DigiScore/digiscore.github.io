DO NOT DELETE THE YMAL CODE ABOVE!!!!!


To use this as a template 

1. first COPY a version of this file into _posts directory.
2. Change the filename to YYYY-MM-DD-new_title_in_this_format.md
3. Put any media/ images in the folder assets/img (ideally 300kb)

Then modify this new file by amending the above YMAL code to:

layout: post (do not touch this line - it must stay as "post")
title: title of post (not title of file!)
subtitle: (optional - delete if you wish)
cover-img: link to the asset media file. Or matching theme image such as digi-mus_banner.png
thumbnail-img: same as cover-img
tags: the category of this post e.g. outputs, case_study, Impact, trans_disciplinary_insights, theory, digital_musicianship (if using more than 1 then must be in [square brackets])

read markdown-basics.md for basic functionality such as inserting images, lists and boxes.

Use this boilerplate code for YouTube videos (change links:)

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="nv-iframe-embed"><iframe loading="lazy" title="TDI 3 - Marc Leman" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PUIbr16p39Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>


**Once you have completed the changes above you can delete the body of this blog and re3place it with you real text (everything below the 2nd set of 3 hyphens)**
