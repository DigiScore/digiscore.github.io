**Principle Investigator:** Craig Vear

**Biog** Craig Vear is Professor of Music and Computer Science at the University of Nottingham split between music and the mixed
reality lab. His research is naturally hybrid as he draws together the fields of music, digital performance, creative technologies,
Artificial Intelligence, creativity, gaming, mixed reality and robotics. He has been engaged in practice-based research with
emerging technologies for nearly three decades, and was editor for The Routledge International Handbook of Practice-Based
Research, published in 2022. His recent monograph The Digital Score: creativity, musicianship and innovation, was published by
Routledge in 2019, and he is Series Editor of Springer’s Cultural Computing Series. In 2021 he was awarded a €2Million ERC
Consolidator Grant to continue to develop his Digital Score research.
