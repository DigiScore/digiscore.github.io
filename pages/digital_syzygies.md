## About
*Digital Syzygies* ia a digital score platform for shared creativity with d/Deaf and autistic musicians, 
that unites creativity and collective involvement in the development of a musical idea. 
*Digital Syzygies* used the Emotiv Insight EEG Headset Brain Interface to connect four musicians who were remotely located 
(in Sweden, Sri Lanka/London, Brighton and Leicester). 
A specially designed Brainwave-to-Music app allowed the brains of the musicians to dictate the course of musical events, 
subject to responses measured by six EEG performance metrics: engagement, excitement, focus, interest, relaxation, stress. 
Each musician contributed samples of sound to a shared library catagorised into the six EEG performance metrics.
This digital score allowed individual musicians to ‘plug’ into a composition using the brain reader, and in realtime control the libraries of self-created sound
files into music. The results are a shjiftng collage of different sounds. This could then be either recorded and shared amongst the team, released as an album, or presented in a 
live performance environment with an instrumentalist reacting to the soundscape and optional visual material.

## Analysis (using the 7 modalities - [LINK](/seven_modalities.md))

**Interface Object**
The music idea embedded in *Digital Syzygies* is immediately communicated through the sense of interconnectivity 
between the EEG headset wearing individual and to both the Brainwave-to-Music app (APP from hereafter) and the network of other EEG headset wearing musiciansd.
Listening is always present in music-making, and a certain amount of supporting/ secondary material is communicated here by this digital score, but not 
the same stuff as with a traditional music ensemble. The immediate phenomenon of experience evoked by this digital score is through the 
interconnetcions between the individual and the network.

**Material Affect**
The sense of being part of a network is primarily responsible for the affectual connections with the musicians. 
It reaches out and draws in relationships through the following aspects, and in doing so shifts the “sense ratios” 
and “patterns of perception steadily and without any resistance” (McLuhan, 1964):
- the networked connection between the individual mind and the APP through the EEG readers
- the connection between all the minds plugged into the APP, with each contributing to a flow of data that effects the decision-making process of the APP 
- the interplay between the APP and the sound composition, and its presence in making real-time decisions based on the EEG data flow
- the presence of the sound library that each individual contributed to as part of the proto-compositional process, and the anticipation of the choices the APP makes (whose file will be played)
- the feeling of resulting sound collage

**Goal**
The goal of *Digital Syzygies* is split between the developmental construction phase, and the realisation event. In the developmental construction phase
the goal for the musician is to select sound sources that are meaningful to them based on each of the six EEG performance metrics (above).This embeds
a individualised sense of ownership with this digital score, and aesthetically contributes to how the work will feel (to them) in the realisation event. 
In the realisation event, each participating musician should concentrate on the emerging soundscape, and be taken on a journey that they are partly constructing and
also unable to control.
