This research seeks to understand stuff that happens inside musicking, and from the perspective of the individual experience as they engage with their digital scores. 


First and foremost, this research believes that to make music is to take part, whether this be performing, composing, coding, listening, dancing. Christopher Small calls this Musicking (1989).
Second, that ‘The act of musicking establishes in the place where it is happening a set of relationships, and it is in those relationships that the meaning of the act lies’ (Small, 1989).
However, meaning should infer the ‘what you mean to me’ (Emmerson 2007), (this subtle shift circumvents the significant issues of value and who is doing the evaluation of meaning). 
Therefore, meaning (or the what-you-mean-to-me) is to be found in the relationships formed between the new creative acts of musicking and the technologies and media of a digital score; 
and these are different from the relationships stimulated with traditional music scores.


In simple terms, musicking = inside perspective. This natural implicates the “I” and “self” as the primary perceiver, which can be considered a phenomenological perspective. 
Through this I aim to unearth how they cope with (make sense of) the connections and relationships that a digital score. 
This is because meaning is to be found in the inter-relationships and inter-connections between musician – technologies – media – music.
As such, we need to ask more questions about the human experience within the relationships between say, media, music, space, sound and the presence of human or machine intelligence.


Phenomenology is a branch of philosophy that deals with the subjective experience of consciousness. 
Following Don Ihde’s writing – based on Husserl, Merleau-Ponty and Heidegger – he presents phenomenological arguments on both music and technology. 
Not wanting to rewrite the whole of it here, it is important to understand what might be happening when we first experience stuff like a digital score, or computational technology, or intelligent agents.
There is, according to Ihde, a *First Phenomenology* which in the next instance retreats into a *Second Phenomenology*. 
The *First* is our immediate experience of some new phenomenon, say a game-engine score, 
and how it shifts our “sense ratios” and “patterns of perception steadily and without any resistance” (McLuhan, 1964). 
This lasts for a brief instance before we start to assign it names, expectations, bias, understanding which are characteristics of the *Second Phenomenology*.


The *DigiScore* research is interested in investigating this *First Phenomenology* as best we can, using methods that help us examine the subjective experience of musicians as they negotiate digital score creativity. 
We feel that a *First* phenomenological approach gets us closer to understanding what is really going on inside musicking. 
This naturally very difficult to define, capture, describe, as these are all traits of a *Second Phenomenology*, so we have established methods that enable us to reverse engineer (as best we can), 
*Second Phenomenology* experience so that it may shine a light on the very instance of a *First Phenomenology*.
