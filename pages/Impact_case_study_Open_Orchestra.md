# **Open Orchestra: Digital Score Creativity Cards to support inclusive music-making within Special Educational Needs.**

Developing creativity cards to support inclusive music-making within Special Educational Needs for a large-scale devised 
digital score composition.  Working with Open Orchestra - an inclusive ensemble from two Special schools in 
Middlesbrough [LINK](https://www.openorchestras.org/) – a set of creativity cards and online resource was designed to 
structure an individual or group through the creative process of developing a digital score. The cards and workshop 
instructions guided a creative music leader through the conceptual ways of thinking and practical stages of development 
a large-scale, cohesive, symphonic work.


## **The Issue**

Developing large-scale musical works for large ensembles requires very different ways of conceptualising, realising and 
inventing musical material. A major factor in this approach is to develop methods, materials and processes to sustain 
musical integrity and cohesiveness across longer timescales, and between larger forces. Compared to smaller scale works, 
with smaller scale musical forces, the challenge increases significantly as enhanced strategies are required to develop 
thematic material over longer periods of time, and across a diversity of musical and instrumental languages. Mastery of 
making work at this scale is developed over many years, and benefits from specialised training, perhaps years of trail 
and error. 

These challenges are compounded when dealing with none-mainstream elements. For example, incorporating digital media 
into the composition as either a digital score or a visual/ projected element requires an equally substantial amount of 
specialist knowledge to master the interdisciplinary creativity. Equally, making large-scale, mixed media works in a 
Special Educational Needs (SEN) context deserves further specialist considerations. Overall, there are very few 
exemplars, guidelines, theories or training available to support such an under-taking. 

The central research question with this project was: can the theories and approaches developed within the digital score 
project provide a support structure to circumvent some of the fundamental issues around large-scale development of works 
for large ensembles of student musicians from SEN schools? 

A secondary question was: how can we encapsulate the theories and approaches of the digital score project into a 
solution that supported brain-storming, ideation, and creativity development of a digital score for a workshop leader 
outside the research team, leading to a successful outcome?


## **The Research**

### Overview


The digital score project worked with the Open Orchestra Middlesbrough music workshop leader Ben Hopkinson on a 
practice-based project that addressed the above concerns. DigiScore’s principal investigator Prof Craig Vear’s 
involvement was 2-fold: 1) providing the theoretical and conceptual guidance to Hopkinson, which supported his 
creativity and framing the conceptual development of his workshop and composition development; 2) Vear designed, 
developed and tested a set of creativity cards and online resource that were capable of operating as Vear in absentia, 
while Hopkinson led the workshops with the members of the Open Orchestra. 

In initial discussion between Vear and Hopkinson, it was highlighted how previous work in this area had tended towards 
shorter scale works with restricted developmental opportunities and issues around the musical notation solutions for SEN 
music students. Additionally, it was observed that combining visuals and music tended towards one force simply being 
played along to another, much like a music video, with very little understanding of the audio-visual contract (Chion 1993) 
and the affective inter-relationships of the audio and visual into a cohesive whole. 

Hopkinson’s desire for this year’s Open Orchestra project (2023-24) was for something that didn’t repeat this pattern 
and to create a cohesive, large-scale work for a large ensemble. This ambition was shared by the music teachers in the 
two SEND schools whose students formed the Open Orchestra Middlesbrough. Furthermore, the students themselves also 
supported this. This was communicated to Vear as a wish list to:

a)	Create a large-scale cohesive symphony work for a large ensemble of music students from Special schools.

b)	Have the student’s creativity drive the workshop process and development of materials used in the work.

c)	Utilise the assistive technologies that are already mastered by the students in their school context as notational 
and instrumental devices, thereby maximising their engagement and potential for creative exploration.

d)	Create an integrated digital media world of live sound, recorded audio and visual media that was more than music 
being played alongside a video.

e)	Develop an innovative notational system that used a clear language appropriate for the SEN students and supported 
their creative invention during workshops, rehearsals and performance.

The project at the centre of this research was “Journey Through a Changing World” a 23-minute, 4 movement large-scale 
work for Open Orchestra, created by Ben Hopkinson and the music student members of the ensemble. It was created over an 
8-month period (December 2023 – July 2024) and premiered at the Middlesbrough Town Hall. 

The visual artist [Layla Curtis](http://laylacurtis.com/) was brought in to co-create with Hopkinson and the ensemble, 
and to offer a visual artists eye and sensibility to the cohesive nature of the digital score. These images then become 
part of the musical score which the orchestra followed (as with a traditionally notated musical score) but with images 
and colours defining what the musicians play. Vear built an interactive software system that allowed Hopkinson to make 
in-the-moment decisions about note choice, and form duration, which the musicians responded to. Overall, the Digital 
Score offered a new way for the students and Hopkinson, to work, create and perform. The young people developed musical 
and compositional ideas, which Hopkinson brought together to create the work.

### Developing the Creativity Cards

The ultimate challenge was the time and availability of Vear to support Hopkinson through the 12-month process of 
developing such an ambitious project. As such, a solution needed to be formed that a) supported the ambition of 
Hopkinson, the teachers and the students, and b) was time-effective for Vear who could not commit to being present 
during the 8-month developmental process across the two schools. The idea for creativity cards was proposed and 
developed.

An inspiration point for the cards was Dr Richard Wetzel’s Mixed Reality Game Cards from 2017 ( Wetzel, Richard, Tom 
Rodden, and Steve Benford. “Developing Ideation Cards for Mixed Reality Game Design.” Transactions of the Digital Games 
Research Association 3, no. 2 (2017). https://doi.org/10.26503/todigra.v3i2.73 ) . Vear had been part of a workshop in 
2016 that had helped develop these cards and had subsequently used them in his own teaching of a module “Performing 
Mixed Reality” over 6 consecutive years at De Montfort University. 

The DigiScore creativity card pack consists of 152 cards. They are organised into 3 separate types: Opportunities, 
Challenges and Questions (mirroring Wetzel’s original cards), each of which offer a different perspective for digital 
score creative thinking. The pack is also organised into the 7 modalities of digital scores, introduced [here](https://digiscore.github.io/pages/seven_modalities/). 
The seven modalities framework can help to define how different 
digital scores exist, are experienced or expressed. These modalities can offer ways of describing, analysing and 
evaluating digital score composition and performance, and as a model for practical exploration of the digital score.

The final version of the pack is available on the DigiScore website for free, together with the instructions and 
examples [LINK](https://digiscore.github.io/pages/Creativity_cards_about/ )


### Developing the workshop practice

An important aspect of this project was to develop Hopkinson to be a confident workshop leader and master of the digital 
score theories and concepts. To achieve this, Vear worked with Hopkinson over a 12-month period in 3 distinct phases:

Phase 1: Fellowship (July 2023) – Hopkinson spent a week embedded in the digital score team, working with Vear to 
understand the basic theoretical structures and approaches to digital score creativity. A first stage version of the 
cards was developed in advance and evaluated by Vear and Hopkinson through a series of rapid-prototypes during this week.

Phase 2: in-vivo workshops (October 2023) – Vear invited Hopkinson to work with the DigiScore research team in a 
creativity card workshop at [Cimarosa Conservatory in Avellino, Italy](https://digiscore.github.io/2024-02-02-Creativity_Cards_Avellino_Italy/). 
This workshop was an opportunity to develop the cards further and to test them on a group of music students, and for 
Hopkinson to see how they are used in practice.

Phase 3: interactive/ technical system design (July 2024) – After a period of creative development between Hopkinson 
and the Open Orchestra music students, a final version of the piece was becoming clear. Hopkinson needed a technical 
solution to bring all the elements of the digital score together, such as visual materials (supplied by Layla Curtis), 
temporal coordination of the sections, scenes, and textures that amounted to the core elements of the score; and a 
solution to interactivity so that Hopkinson could change visual elements to offer cues for the musicians, or to change 
colours of screens to signal note changes.



## **The Outcomes** 

The focus of this research project was on the transformation in Ben Hopkinson’s practice and creative potential to lead 
an inclusive ensemble to large-scale co-devised digital score composition. For Hopkinson he recognised that adopting the 
digital score theories and using the creativity cards to structure workshops transformed the following aspects of his 
practice:

•	Immersive Experience: The immersive narrative score project transformed musical creativity by integrating narrative 
and visual elements, making complex musical ideas more accessible to a wider audience. 

•	Inclusive Practices: Efforts to engage SEND (Special Educational Needs and Disabilities) children and others through 
non-traditional methods and digital scores indicate a transformative approach to inclusivity in music education and 
performance. 

•	Audience Engagement: By providing an immersive experience, the project transformed the way audiences engage with 
music, making it more captivating and memorable. 

•	Evolving Techniques: The gradual development from initial ideas to more refined performances, as seen through weekly 
sessions and feedback loops, illustrates the transformative journey of both the project and its participants. 

•	Educational Impact: The process of creating and performing "Journey" was a transformative learning experience for 
the musicians, inspiring them to discover music in unconventional places and contexts. 

Although not directly involved in the research case study, the music teachers offered the Digital Score project some 
observations about how their students engaged with this Open Orchestra project, and how this had differed from their 
previous engagements over the past 5 years. These are listed in more detail [Beverley School impact](/assets/docs/neil_t_impact.pdf) 
and [Priory Woods School impact](/assets/docs/adam_f_impact.pdf), and highlight how Hopkinson and their “Journey Through 
a Changing World” project had impact on the following areas:

-	Musical development
-	Creativity and Imaginative development
-	Social interactions, social coherence and collaborative working
-	Confidence, self-esteem and emotional development
-	Cognitive development.

**Layla Curtis - visual artist**
Layla Curtis (b.1975, UK) is a British artist whose practice has a focus on place, landscape and mapping. Her multi-form 
work examines the attempts we make to chart the earth, how we locate ourselves, navigate space and represent terrain. 
She is concerned with how we map borders and boundaries, both real and metaphorical, to define territories and to 
establish a sense of place. She explores how we perceive, make use of and interact with the spaces we inhabit. Often, 
she seeks to understand place by examining its connections with elsewhere. [Website](http://laylacurtis.com/)
