# **JoyInst: Digital Score for inclusive music education for disabled children in Kenya.**

Developing a digital score as a platform for inclusive music education for disabled children in Kenya. The 
digital score was embedded with a learning game, and a low-cost digital instrument interface that break barriers of 
accessibility to music education and making, while building bridges towards inclusive music-making and learning.


## **The Issue**

In many cultures around the world being a disabled child means being segregated: different schools, different opportunities,
different funding, different access. In music education that can involve having limited access to instruments and 
learning because of the dominance of a "mainstream" focus on what instruments, participation modes, and 
expectations of excellence is acceptable. This can mean that for a disabled child who can not play am mainstream 
instrument such as a recorder, could be excluded from mainstream music education, or their access several reduced as
her needs cannot be met. 

There are, of course, accessible instruments that can help bridge this gap, but funding for disabled music education 
cannot always stretch to this. And even when it can, there is still the issue of acceptance of such an instrument
in mainstream music-making: an accessible instrument can highlight difference, be difficult to train in mainstream ways. 

Music-making can be a key element in music learning, when the aspects of theory, skill training, ear-to-hand coordination,
creativity, self-beliefs and imagination are tested and formulated. It is an enjoyable, and playful aspect of music 
education and a contributor to social integration. However, segregation and difference can compound into 'otherness' 
which can further exclude disabled children.

## **The Research**

The Digital Score PI was presented with these issues as part of an undergraduate project he was supervising at the Music 
department of University of Nottingham. The student - Kelvin Macharia, himself a disabled musician from Kenya - was 
investigating music education for disabled children in Kenya, and identified these key issues above and was seeking to 
understand how digital technologies might address the inclusion inbalance. 

Following a survey of existing digital accessible instruments, Vear defined a wish-list of features that could be
used as design considerations for an interactive digital score solution that:

- 1 was low cost to maximise availability, affordability and therefore opportunity
- 2 offered challenge and skill generation akin to learning mainstream instruments, and would be perceived on an equal, effort-earned status
- 3 had some "street cred" and of intrigue to non-disabled music students
- 4 offered a broad range of input solutions, and easily adaptable to accommodate as wide a range of accessibility as possible 
- 5 embedded mainstream music theory, so that a common language was taught, perhaps even opening the system out to grades
- 6 was scalable

Vear's solution was to build a digital score around readily available games controllers such as XBox, PlayStation. His
proposition was that they were relatively low-cost (e.g. £30 for a Logitech controller online), has some "street-cred",
were pervasive in home environments that owned a games console, and were designed to usable. The advantage in an 
inclusive situation is that many manufacturers now supply accessible controllers (such as PlayStation's _Access_), for 
a relatively low price (£75), with other more bespoke accessible games controllers easily built through DIY kits or 
bought online.

The controller alone, was only a single aspect of _JoyInst_ with its programmed "learning game" another design aspect.
_JoyInst_ had 2 selectable modes: 1) open play, where the musician could freely play notes using the joystick and 
associated buttons for sharps and flats, and octave shifts, as well as volume control. There was also a selection of 
instruments ranging from flutes, kalimba, moog synth and vocal effects, enabling a group to be formed with different
sound and parts. 2) the second mode was the "learning game" that presented a simple "follow-my-leader" game where notes
were presented on the game stave (lowest in the figure above) and the musicians had to reply with that notes to move 
onto the next. The game was designed in levels, starting with simple octaves, and adding increasing complexity with 5ths,
3rds, and then into sharps and flats.

Because _JoyInst_ was a digital score, the feel of the whole experience was considered in the design (see game design below. 
Sound effects 
were embedded into the user interface, as was level indicators, lives and progression comments. The design revolved 
around _neoscore_ (a DigiScore project) that supported the realtime generation of the onscreen notation, and enabled 
various help symbols to be embedded in the score. Easy mode showed the note, with a coloured arrow (determining the 
joystick direction and using colours to highlight the specific notes), and also the note name, both 
anchored in the notation. The help symbols were removed with each correct answer, or added when mistakes were made.

## **The Outcomes** (written by Kelvin Macharia and Craig Vear)

Macharia's research project at SA Joytown Secondary School exceeded our hopes and expectations in several ways as 
_JoyInst_ was received in an overwhelmingly positive light. Observing the complex musical 
activities the students could undertake with just a few goes of playing was surprising and rewarding for both Macharia, 
and the research participant, the music teacher at Joytown. For example, with just about an hour of playing the 
instrument, students could play the technical exercises required for their national exams (The Kenya Certificate of 
Secondary Education), such as scales and arpeggios. They also explored creating their own melodies, and set about 
playing various pieces in a group ensemble with singers.

The instrument also gamified the process of learning. Using the step-by-step lessons that Vear had embedded in the
_JoyInst_ "learning game", the students felt supported to undertake these complex musical activities, capitalising on 
their productivity and engaged for long periods of time. As the music teacher remarked, this instrument was not like 
any other traditional instrument because it was also a rewarding game for the young people. The teacher went on to say 
it was the most engaging instrument he had seen students use, and thanks to this, some students who were previously 
struggling to keep engaged in class showed considerable interest 
in the subject, which was a surprise to the teacher. His only hope was that this interest would be sustained after the 
study, hence the need to continue this research and develop _JoyInst_ further.

_JoyInst_ presented two central answers as a solution for the access. The first one was cost-efficiency, which is a key 
hindrance to disabled people accessing music in Kenya, most of whom come from low-income backgrounds. With cheap and 
relatively accessible game controllers and a piece of software, young people were able to undertake increasingly complex musical 
activities. The instrument also presented easily adjustable software, which could accommodate different controllers that 
worked for different musicians. This is a level of customisation that is unprecedented in the Kenyan music education 
scene, yet a necessity for disabled musicians who have unique needs that their controller/ interfaces need to accommodate.

The other important solution that _JoyInst_ presented to the music teacher at Joytown was its ability to combine music 
theory and practical musicianship into one. Our research shows that combining music theory and the act of music-making is a 
significant challenge for many secondary school students in Kenya. This was also the case for the students at Joytown, 
as the music teacher revealed. In his long teaching career, he was used to having students who could write the music but 
had challenges performing it, or vice versa. However, _JoyInst_ combined elements of sightreading, aural musicianship,
hand-ear coordination and performance into one. The musicians could see the note they were playing, hear it and perform 
it simultaneously, 
which, as the teacher observes, goes a long way in creating holistic musicians who can hear, read and perform music.

While this was intended to solve the challenges that disabled people face in music education, particularly a largely 
unaccommodating education system and the high cost of acquiring traditional instruments and virtually unaffordable 
adapted instruments, it solves problems that are not unique to disabled musicians. Consequently, the music teacher at 
Joytown sees it as the future of music education in Kenya.
