## Design (refer to typology [LINK](/typology.md))
**Type:** *10 - The Living Score* is characterized by the use of intelligent computation systems as a co-creational other 
inside the flow of musicking. There are several different approaches to the implementation of computational intelligence 
within the digital score with each offering differing degrees of felt co-operation, presence and autonomy.


## About
*Solaris* is a digital score for Al and a human musician that questions the nature of sentience. It uses real-time Al 
and deep learning prediction to create a free, jazz, Al, math music performance. The digita score is both an agent 
expressing itself by joining in with the "musicking" through symbolic rules, and a visual notation tool.

## Analysis (using the 7 modalities - [LINK](/seven_modalities.md))

**Interface Object**

 The music idea embedded in *Netronomia* is communicated through the visual and hearing sense crucially as a portal to the 
 spatial sense of the network. The virtualized space of the network is the true host of the musical idea.


**Material Affect**

It is the virtual space generated by the network that is primarily responsible for the affectual connections. This space
reaches out to the performers through the visual score and perceived heard interactions. The rhythmic patterns break 
down that physical distance into a set of close, musically-articulate relationships.


**Goal**

The goal of this digital score is to play the rhythmical score presented to each performer as accurately as possible 
while maintaining a sense of musical togetherness and trust. This is enhanced by the close relationships of the 
material affect and maintained by the clever calculations of latency and sub-division. This is truly a unique property 
of this digital score's approach to networked music.


**Content**

The primary signals that convey meaning in *Netronomia* are the representations of virtualised rhythmic space as rotating 
visual graphics. This both offers concrete measurements and articulations of when to play 'together', and also freedom
to make some harmonic decisions. A critical element is the dynamic movement of the large cog design which acts as a 
metaphor for the rhythmical connectivity of the network.


**Language**

The language of this digital score is both iconic and sensory. In the top corner is a list of standard notation notes,
that define the harmonic territory for each musician, this changes over time and is distributed amongst the networked 
ensemble. The main language is the coloured cog at the centre which offers iconic measurements of time and when-to-play
with a colour system that allows the other performers in the ensemble to have presence.


**Feedback**

Having ones trust in their own rhythmical accuracy confirmed by the synchronicity of others playing at the same time, or 
in syncopated patterns. The coherence of these patterns across the network and within shifting latency, is the core 
feedback for a performance.


**Flow**

Flow in *Netronomia* should be understood by the binding nature of this digital score of all performers into this
virtualised network space. If they feel a sense of togetherness then they can start to flow with their music. The 
influence of the visual and aural elements is a critical factor here, but "following the score" accurately is not enough
to deliver a solid performance. The musicians must tread on the tight-rope of blind faith and trust the algorythm
is going to synchronise each performer into a pleasurable musical experience and sense of togetherness. Once this has 
been felt the true relationships in this musical idea can start to be formed.
