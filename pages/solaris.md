## Design (refer to typology [LINK](/typology.md))
**Type:** *10 - The Living Score* is characterized by the use of intelligent computation systems as a co-creational other 
inside the flow of musicking. There are several different approaches to the implementation of computational intelligence 
within the digital score with each offering differing degrees of felt co-operation, presence and autonomy.


## About
*Solaris* 

FREEDOM. TOGETHERNESS. EMERGENCE.

This Digital Score (Vear 2019) is a jazz quartet created from 3 creative-AI agents (piano, bass and TR909 drum machine) 
and a single human musician (drum kit). It uses abstract visual notation and the behaviours of creative AI to stimulate 
relationships inside music that are used to communicate musical ideas to the human. The creative-AI is built using an 
approach called Embodied Intelligence (Vear 2022) and exemplifies the application of the Human-AI Musicking Framework 
(Vear et al 2023). Solaris uses Creative AI datasets and algorithms to make music from inside the flow (Vear et al 2024). 

Embodied Intelligence differs from other music-AI approaches insofar that it is not using AI to construct the physical 
phenomena of music (sound wave), nor the meta-workings of music composition (sequencing of notes). Instead, the AI is 
powering the realtime generation of core impetus from within the dynamic flow of live music-making (Poltronieri & Vear 
2024, Small 1998). The digital score is both an agent expressing itself by joining in with the "musicking" through symbolic rules, 
and a visual notation tool. Overall, this AI digital score has been designed to make humans more creative.

## Analysis (using the 7 modalities - [LINK](/seven_modalities.md))

**Interface Object**

The music idea embedded in *Solaris* is communicated through the visual and hearing senses. An additional critical aspect
of communications is the operational presence of the AI.

**Material Affect**

The material aspects of communication that affectual connect with the musician in *Solaris* are balanced between three
domains: the sounding world, the visual poetics and the operational behaviour of the AI

The sounding world is relatively easy to comprehend: *Solaris* is improvising in a free-jazz world, that is linked to 
chords and the jazz theory of George Russell. So the sound of this jazz world, however abstract, is one affectual tendril.

The 2nd and 3rd are more abstract, yet need to work in sympathy with the sounding world so as not to distract or confuse
the human musician. The first of these is the visual poetics and what the AI chooses to show in each moment, and what the human
chooses for it to represent. It is the flow and changes of these images and the abstract meaning they offer in-the-moment
that is of primary concern.

Secondly, and more importantly, is the AIâ€™s presence, its behaviours in the flow/musicking dance; the human musicians'
perception of it co-creating with ME as a partner in the dance.


**Goal**

The goal of this digital score is rather simple, to create an improvised flow-based, post-modern, free, math-AI jazz sound.


**Content**

The primary signals that convey meaning in *Solaris* a balanced combination between the sounding world, visual poetics
and the behaviours presence of the AI INSIDE the flow of musicking. Individually each of these aspects operate as expected:
it sounds like jazz, the abstract images look like jazz inspired abstract expressionism (although not designed 
explicitly to represent this), and the AI feels like it is responding in the hear-and-now (sic). But there is another 
layer that emerges out of this, which is the perception of "my" awareness of its awareness of "me", and perhaps 
the feeling of it having a perceptual experience (Robert Kirk) in the shared flow. It is this connection between the AI
and the human (in this case the PI Vear), and the human's perception of the AI's connection with him, through the flow
that is of primary concern and contains the primary content for the musical idea.


**Language**

The language of this digital score is both iconic and sensory and is balanced between the 3 sensorial domains: the sound 
world 


**Feedback**

Having ones trust in their own rhythmical accuracy confirmed by the synchronicity of others playing at the same time, or 
in syncopated patterns. The coherence of these patterns across the network and within shifting latency, is the core 
feedback for a performance.


**Flow**

Flow in *Netronomia* should be understood by the binding nature of this digital score of all performers into this
virtualised network space. If they feel a sense of togetherness then they can start to flow with their music. The 
influence of the visual and aural elements is a critical factor here, but "following the score" accurately is not enough
to deliver a solid performance. The musicians must tread on the tight-rope of blind faith and trust the algorythm
is going to synchronise each performer into a pleasurable musical experience and sense of togetherness. Once this has 
been felt the true relationships in this musical idea can start to be formed.
