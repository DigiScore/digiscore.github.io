## Introduction

The Digital Score team have established a concert ensemble specialising in the interpretation, realisation and sharing 
of digital scores from a range of musicians across the planet. We commission new works, presents masterclasses and 
workshop student work-in-progress. The ensemble provides core instrumentalists and is augmented by 
local musicians giving them hands-on experience with digital score creativity and musicianship.

Each concert is different and can be designed to fit the needs of a venue. The theme of this concert series is 
*Typology of Digital Scores (from animated to AI)*. Here is a typical programme for a 60-minute concert:


- *Variations 1* John Cage and Decibel Ensemble. (any number of players)

### Technical Rider
The DigiScore Ensemble travels relatively light and requires only a minimal amount of tech to support a concert.
For a typical concert we would require the following tech support:

- Stage large enough for 10 instrumentalists
- Large projector and screen. HDMI input (positioned behind the ensemble)
- Large TV screen for onstage monitoring. 40-60inch HDMI input (mirroring the projected image)
- Stereo full range speakers (positioned downstage of ensemble)
- Mixing desk large enough for the ensemble (typically 8-16 analogue channels)
- Selection of microphones for the ensemble (if space is too large for acoustic sounds)
- 2 small monitors for on stage
- 4 small tables and armless comfortable chairs for each performer
- Small guitar amp (TBC)
- 3 electric points on stage (we will bring all extensions)
- Some lighting to add performance atmosphere (optional)
