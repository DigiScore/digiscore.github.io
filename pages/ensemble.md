## Introduction

The Digital Score team have established a concert ensemble specialising in the interpretation, realisation and sharing 
of digital scores from a range of musicians across the planet. We commission new works, presents masterclasses and 
workshop student work-in-progress. The ensemble provides core instrumentalists and is augmented by 
local musicians giving them hands-on expereince with digital score creativity and musicianship.
