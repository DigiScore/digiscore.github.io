### Our Project

The core aims of the project are to:

1) determine scientific knowledge of how digital scores stimulate new creative opportunities and experiences within a range of music practices,

2) develop a theoretical framework for digital scores as an important transdisciplinary area of research,

3) build a scientific study of inclusive digital musicianship through the transformative potential of the digital score.
 
### Our Project

The “Digital Scores” project comprises an ambitious programme of practice-based research interwoven with an innovative theoretical investigation into the transformation of the music score through new computational technologies.

DigiScore is the first large-scale, integrated project to address these challenges. The high-level objectives of this research project are to:


1) determine how new computational technologies, integrated as innovative music score systems, can lead to the communication of innovative music ideas, new music experiences, novel compositional approaches, new performance opportunities and music-making engagements, and broader accessibility for musicians of traditional and non-traditional backgrounds.


2) develop a transdisciplinary theoretical framework that situates digital scores within the wider fields of human-computer interaction, digital humanities and media studies, in order to understand the deep creative experiences of musicking (the act of music-making (Small 1989)) with digital scores built around artificial intelligence, machine learning, internet networking, robotics, virtual and augmented reality, gaming and physical computing.


3) discover how digital scores stimulate new relationships between musicians and how these profoundly influence the nature of the digital musician.


This project will investigate these questions through an innovative combination of artistic and scientific research methods, undertaken by a transdisciplinary and international team of scientists and artists
