## Design (refer to typology [LINK](/typology.md))
**Type:** *9- Networked Ensembles ~ Connected Scores* co-located performers are linked together in a network that is 
operational in binding these musicians to a central music concept. It focuses on the technological solutions for 
organising, sharing and distributing compositional materials for the enhancement of collective musicking.


## About
*Netronomia* uses the Netronome, a networked metronome developed at UCSB by Ethan Cayko, to create a multi-city 
rhythmic work. It addresses the challenge of synchronising performers across different locations with varying latencies, 
making rhythmic accuracy difficult without adjustment. The Netronome facilitates calibration of timing relationships, 
enabling musicians to play together despite being physically apart. The Netronome introduces rhythmic offsets due to 
latency, resulting in performers experiencing different rhythmic versions of the same music. The Netronome challenges 
traditional notions of musical scores by materially structuring the temporal space between performers. Unlike 
traditional scores, it not only provides instructions for sound production but also regulates temporal relationships 
among performers. This feature could empower composers to craft desired rhythmic units and give musicians control over 
their performances, mitigating the impact of network latency on intentionality.

## Analysis (using the 7 modalities - [LINK](/seven_modalities.md))

**Interface Object**

 


**Material Affect**

The visual game design is primarily responsible for the affectual connections with the musician. 
It reaches out and draws in relationships through the following aspects, and in doing so shifts the “sense ratios” and 
“patterns of perception steadily and without any resistance” (McLuhan, 1964):
- visual design of an open world role-player game (RPG)
- presence of the underlying algorithm and its decision making process
- the maze/ game design map on the screen
- live processing of the guitar sound


**Goal**

The goal of this digital score is to follow the realtime generated path through the maze, and to play (as best as possible) 
the notation that each leg of the maze presents on the screen.


**Content**

The primary signals that convey meaning in *GuitaRPG* are:
- signs and shapes generated using the neoscore notation software
- the pre-defined effects controlling the live processing of sound


**Language**

The language of this digital score is either iconic and sensory with the performer able to make decisions about which
on-the-fly depending on on-sreen density and abstraction, and their ongoing dramaturgy of the piece.
Iconic interpretations rely on the canonical semiotics of Western European Art Music and the traditional notation system,
and the use of guitar tablature and chord diagrams.
Sensory interpretations are informed by this, but are freed from rhetoric when the performer wishes, or needs too because of density and complexity.
An additional language is the realtime response from the live audio processing. This helps the performer to make decisions about placement, timing, duration
as well as iconic or sensory modes.


**Feedback**

The animated nature of the maze offers constant reference to the position of the score. The sound design of the live processing offers 
guidence to the type of interpretation, and also grounds the performance in the sound-world defined by the composer.


**Flow**

Flow in *GuitaRPG* is embedded within its gamified nature. Like an open-world game, the map in the top corner offers a global view of the music-world, 
with specific details only apparent when the player ventures (or is taken) into one of its branches. And like an open-world game
the flow of engagement is infused with a spirit of adventure, where abstract chords, multiple dots, obscure guitar notation
and unusual coloured shapes confront the voyager and demands to be made into meaning.
