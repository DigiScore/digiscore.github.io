**The Digital Score Creativity Cards**
These cards have been created to help you design, develop and create digital scores. They present insights from 
different perspectives on the possibilities, opportunities, challenges and questions around the creation of a digital score. 
They have been designed to operate like a conversation between you, your creative ideas, and the wealth of experience from 
those who have researched and specialise in making digital scores. The hope is that they offer new ways of thinking, 
creating, performing and sharing your musical ideas in the 21st Century.

**What is a digital score?**
Simply put a digital score is much like a traditional music score: it is a communications package of a musical idea 
that is sharable. However, digital scores use the creative potential of technology to expand on the types of musical 
ideas that can be shared and expressed as a music score. 

They are the next evolutionary step of the traditional paper-based score. But instead of being limited to a piece of 
paper (or PDF) as the “package” with which a musical idea is shared or being restricted by the limitations of printing 
press technology, a digital score benefits from the creative potential of all technologies. So if you want to explore 
animated scores where the notation moves about on a screen, or you want the digital score to be like a computer game 
where player interaction is key, or you wish to explore robotics or AI, then these digital score creativity cards can 
help you package your musical idea in such a way that it is communicated to other musicians, again and again. 

**Notation vs The Language of a Score**
A traditional score is more than just the notation printed on it. Reading from Bach’s original handwritten manuscript is 
a vastly distinct experience from reading those same notes from a version created in Sibelius: same notes, different 
platforms, different worlds, different meanings. With a digital score, we must address our own tendencies to think of a 
score as being solely about the notation. Notation is an important symbol-based mechanism with which certain musical 
ideas can be expressed and presented to other musicians. But when we are creating digital scores we have access to all 
sorts of media, all sorts of technology, and all sorts of senses (eyes, ears, touch etc.). And crucially it allows all 
sorts of musicians the opportunities to express their musical ideas in a way of their choosing. 

Common notation is a useful symbol system used by millions of musicians around the world, for many, many years. But if 
your musical idea can’t be expressed with static notes on a stave, or it is too complex to anchor onto a fixed page, or 
the musicians you are working with do not read common notation, or you want to express contemporary ideas in way that 
adopts contemporary culture and technology, or you want to explore AI agents or gaming interactivity then a new system 
of language will be needed --- one that allows you to express your idea in a score, and this may be a new form of 
notation, but equally it could be colours, shapes, sounds, pre-recorded instructions, data visualisations, dancing 
robots or AI improvising partners.

**Open conversations with the cards**
We would like to think that these cards encapsulate a lot of our knowledge about creativity in, with and through digital 
scores. Therefore, we hope that each card presents a part of our knowledge for you to use as a conversation point about 
your digital score. You might find that through these conversations your ideas have become enhanced or transformed. You 
might find that it presents a certain challenge that you hadn't considered and can now discuss with yourself or your team. 
You might find that the conversation is seemingly irrelevant to your idea; but do discuss it and then discard it. There 
is no right or wrong here, but we do ask that you enter an open conversation and that you allow your ideas to grow, 
transform, adapt, change and become enhanced.

**Examples of Rapid Prototyping Digital Scores: getting to the core of the experience.**

*Example 1: small world game design*
Musicians X, Y and Z have designed a digital score that is based in a computer game world. It is an environmental-focused 
score where musicians need to collect birds by playing melodies of bird songs. Once collected these birds are then ‘saved’. 
The composition ends when enough birds have been saved to rebalance the ecosystem.

For their rapid prototype, they built a small world using LEGO. This world looked a little like a jungle (one of the 
scenes in their score). They had written out melodic lines on paper manuscripts and cut them into small chunks. They 
made small birds out of 3 LEGO blocks; each bird a different colour and attached the manuscript extracts with sticky 
tape. This world was placed in a cardboard box, with the front missing, and quickly painted to look like the sky.

Within 60 minutes of doing this, they were ready for an external musician (soprano sax) to try the rapid prototype. 
The saxophonist was told what the LEGO world was meant to represent, and the goal of the score along with the initial 
performers' instructions. The musician sat in front of a large TV screen in a different part of the room from the LEGO 
world; the small world was transmitted to the screen using WhatsApp video. Musicians X and Y would move the birds around 
the small world while Z moved the phone around like the camera function in a computer game. They were listening and 
responding to the saxophonist’s sounds. 

This small-world experiment of the digital score was chosen because its core experience was being communicated through 
the interactivity between the saxophonist sound and the game world. If this aspect of the digital score design did not 
work or was substandard musicians X, Y and Z would never know the core communications functions of the score.

The demo lasted 6 minutes. Immediately following the demo, the team got together, and the saxophonist explained how 
it felt to be playing inside the score, what they expected to be happening, and surprising areas they liked. The team 
discussed the next steps, and very quickly made amendments and enhancements, made a second small world (a seascape) 
and added different animals as requested by the saxophonist. The saxophonist also wanted to have the camera movement 
linked to her saxophone, so she was in control of the live image. 

After a couple more sessions, musicians X, Y and Z had deep insights into how the digital score might work when it is 
made in a Unity games engine. At the same time, because of their hands-on experience of moving the birds around and 
listening to the musician's live performances, they were able to programme the non-player-character aspects of the game 
world with ease and accuracy.

This process enabled musicians X, Y and Z to get quickly to the core experience of this digital score, and because of 
this to build quickly and effectively the digital score proper.


*Example 2: animated score*
Musician A used the cards and designed a digital score as a fixed animated film. It was to deconstruct a violin and 
build a collage of ‘materials’ pertaining to a violin such as wood, metal string, pegs and violin music. The fixed 
animated film was to journey across these materials laid out in a sequence, for example, a piece of string leading to a 
bit of music manuscript from Mozart, leading to pieces of wood. Musician A, a violinist herself, would use these elements 
to “reconstruct” the violin through improvised sound. 

The core experience with this digital score was to be felt in the balance between how the abstract and musical materials 
were presented on the screen, and the tempo of the journey in the collage. A rapid prototype experiment was set up that 
used bits of stuff that were lying around the classroom that resembled the materials of a violin. These were laid out 
in a journey, and a quick video made with her phone. Following the first test, a new journey was laid out and recorded, 
then another.

Through these early experiments, core experiences of balance, tempo, complexity of materials and assemblage were 
determined, and a final version was made relatively quickly once the proper materials were found.


*Example 3: AI ensemble*
Musicians R, S and T designed a digital score using AI, which would listen to a live musician playing a fixed melodic 
line and build a unique backing track for them based on their emotional mood. The AI would generate chords by analysing 
the live musicians playing in realtime and measure their arousal through on-body sensors (EDA). Together the AI and the 
live musician would make the music in the here and now, with each performance of the digital score creating a different 
version of the piece but the melodic line remaining fixed.

The core experience would be how the AI measured the live musician and made a response in realtime. This would be felt 
as new and engaging, perhaps like a duet. Musician R would perform the melodic line on guitar with musicians S and T 
operating the AI.

To kickstart the experiment the musicians composed a short melodic line and built a quick harmonic matrix that would 
work with it. The rapid prototype experiment used a Wizard of Oz approach for the AI. This involved musicians S and T 
pretending to be the AI in another room (like the Wizard of Oz in the film). Musician S would watch musician R through 
a live video feed and make judgments about their arousal state, signalling this to musician T by lifting or lowering his 
arm. Musician T would then play chords using a found keyboard sound in Garageband and referencing the harmonic matrix as 
a guide to what he was playing. This was then broadcast back onto musician R over the video feed.

After one experiment the trio discussed the core experience. Decisions were made about extending the melodic line and 
building rules for how the arousal measurement could be translated to the harmonic matrix. Extra AI control qualities 
were also introduced. 

Over a 3-hour process, the musicians felt that they understood the key behaviours of the AI and were then able to spend 
the lengthy process of building it in Python knowing that it would work. They also knew what material worked for the 
melodic line, and harmonic matrix.
