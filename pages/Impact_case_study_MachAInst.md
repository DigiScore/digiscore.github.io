# **MachAInst: Digital Score for inclusive music education for disabled musicians in Kenya.**

Developing a digital score that extended the creativity of disabled and non-disabled musicians within an 
inclusive music ensemble. The digital score used AI and a robotic arm to bind these musicians in a shared creative 
improvisation with all the musicians benefiting, practices enhanced and relationships transformed.

## **The Research**

The Digital Score project (DigiScore) worked in collaboration with 



## **The Outcomes**

Macharia's research project at SA Joytown Secondary School exceeded our hopes and expectations in several ways. 
MachAInst, as a digital solution, was received in an overwhelmingly positive light. Observing the complex musical 
activities the students could undertake with just a session of experience was surprising and rewarding for both the 
researcher, Macharia, and the participant, the music teacher at Joytown. With just about an hour of playing the 
instrument, students could play the technical exercises required for their national exams (The Kenya Certificate of 
Secondary Education), such as scales and arpeggios, create their own melodies, and play various pieces they were 
singing on MachAInst.

The instrument also gamified the process of learning how to undertake these complex musical activities, capitalising on 
blissful productivity. As the music teacher remarked, this instrument was not like any other traditional instrument 
because it was also a rewarding game for the young people. It was the most engaging instrument he had seen students use, 
and thanks to this, some students who were previously struggling to keep engaged in class showed considerable interest 
in the subject, which was a surprise to the teacher. His only hope was that this interest would be sustained after the 
study, hence the need to continue this research and develop MachAInst further.

MachAInst presented two central answers as a solution for the access. The first one was cost-efficiency, which is a key 
hindrance to disabled people accessing music in Kenya, most of whom come from low-income backgrounds. With cheap and 
relatively accessible game controllers and a piece of software, young people were able to undertake complex musical 
activities. The instrument also presented easily adjustable software, which could accommodate different controllers that 
worked for different musicians. This is a level of customisation that is unprecedented in the Kenyan music education 
scene, yet a necessity for disabled musicians who have unique needs that their instruments need to accommodate.

The other important solution that MachAInst presented to the music teacher at Joytown was its ability to combine music 
theory and practical musicianship into one. As research shows, combining music theory and the act of music-making is a 
significant challenge for many secondary school students in Kenya. This was also the case for the students at Joytown, 
as the music teacher revealed. In his long teaching career, he was used to having students who could write the music but 
had challenges performing it, or vice versa. However, MachAInst combined elements of sight reading, aural musicianship 
and performance into one. The musicians could see the note they were playing, hear it and perform it simultaneously, which, as the teacher observes, goes a long way 
in creating wholistic musicians who can hear, read and perform music.

While this was intended to solve the challenges that disabled people face in music education, particularly a largely 
unaccommodating education system and the high cost of acquiring traditional instruments and virtually unaffordable 
adapted instruments, it solves problems that are not unique to disabled musicians. Consequently, the music teacher at 
Joytown, who was the participant in this study, sees it as the future of music education in Kenya. In the next stages of 
its development, Macharia hopes that the instrument will notate the sheet music that one plays on it. This feature will 
benefit students who cannot write, as the participant in this study observes. Overall, this was an exciting, insightful, 
and quite rightly a life-transforming study!

# **Participants**

**Kelvin Macharia**
Macharia is a disabled musician from Kenya, currently studying for a BA(Hons) in Music at the University of Nottingham. 
His final year research project investigated

**Deirdre Bencsik and Clare Bhabra**
Deirdre is a professional cellist and Clare a professional violinist who are both long-standing members of Sinfonia Viva, 
a UK based orchestra and educational organisation. Their performance practice is rooted in the classical tradition reading 
from standard western notation. Both Deirdre and Clare improvise in some community-based projects but both professed to 
not being confident improvisers. Neither employ any digital technology in their own practice, although Anonymous do 
sometimes collaborate with digital musicians and artists on some projects.
