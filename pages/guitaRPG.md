## Design (refer to typology [LINK](/typology.md))
**Type:** *Creative System* are composite constructions of pre-defined audio, dynamic visual information and sound processing, 
all controlled and coordinated through a central computer environment.


## About
*GuitaRPG* is an interactive 2-dimensional score through which the performer may freely navigate. 
Taking inspiration from Role Playing Games (RPGs), the performer may move through regions of the score at their own pace, 
each region featuring its own distinct soundscape. Upon encountering a new region, the performer will be presented with a new sound or 
technique to explore on their instrument, accumulating sounds all the way until the climax at the end of the piece. 
The more times a performer encounters a particular technique, the more they ‘level-up’ and unlock more variations of that technique. 
This piece was commissioned by Craig Vear and the Digiscore research project, and created using the neoscore python library, 
developed principally by Andrew Yoon.

## Analysis (using the 7 modalities - [LINK](/seven_modalities.md))

**Interface Object**
The music idea embedded in *GuitaRPG* is immediately communicated through the visual sense, specifically using *neoscore* software as a game design. 
Listening is always present in music-making, and a certain amount of supporting/ secondary material is communicated here by this digital score through
the live processing of the guitar. The immediate phenomenon of experience evoked by this digital score is visual.


**Material Affect**
The visual game design is primarily responsible for the affectual connections with the musician. 
It reaches out and draws in relationships through the following aspects, and in doing so shifts the “sense ratios” and 
“patterns of perception steadily and without any resistance” (McLuhan, 1964):
- visual design of an open world role-player game (RPG)
- presence of the underlying algorithm and its decision making process
- the maze/ game design map on the screen
- live processing of the guitar sound


**Goal**
The goal of this digital score is to follow the realtime generated path through the maze, and to play (as best as possible) 
the notation that each leg of the maze presents on the screen.
