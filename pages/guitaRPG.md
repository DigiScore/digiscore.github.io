## Design (refer to typoology [LINK](/typeology.md))
**Type:** *Creative System* are composite constructions of pre-defined audio, dynamic visual information and sound processing, all controlled and coordinated through a central computer environment.


## About
*GuitaRPG* is an interactive 2-dimensional score through which the performer may freely navigate. 
Taking inspiration from Role Playing Games (RPGs), the performer may move through regions of the score at their own pace, 
each region featuring its own distinct soundscape. Upon encountering a new region, the performer will be presented with a new sound or 
technique to explore on their instrument, accumulating sounds all the way until the climax at the end of the piece. 
The more times a performer encounters a particular technique, the more they ‘level-up’ and unlock more variations of that technique. 
This piece was commissioned by Craig Vear and the Digiscore research project, and created using the neoscore python library, 
developed principally by Andrew Yoon.
