## Design (refer to typology [LINK](/typology.md))
**Type:** 10 - *The Living Score* is characterized by the use of intelligent computation systems as a co-creational other inside the flow of 
musicking. There are several approaches to the implementation of computational intelligence within the digital score with each 
offering differing degrees of felt co-operation, presence and autonomy.


## About
*Jess+* is an intelligent digital score system for shared creativity with a mixed ensemble of able-bodied and disabled musicians. 
The digital score uses AI and a robotic arm to enhance the real-time dynamic engagement of the disabled musician with the 
able-bodied musicians allowing her to thrive in a realtime communication beyond what has so far been possible.
AI and robotic technologies are used to extend the crea-tivity of disabled musicians. In a realtime music feedback loop, 
a disabled musician (A) is “plugged into” a creative AI robot arm that draws graphic music notation which is performed 
live by other musicians (B). The creative AI and the disabled musician work as an extended system, with each feeding the other: 
the AI reads the real-time brainwaves and arousal data of the human (A), and (A) feels the embodied behaviour of the robot arm. 
The feed-back loop is closed as the live musicians (B) make sound, which in turn is heard by both the AI and humans (A+B). 
In this system, the AI and the robot arm is not an assistive tool, but rather co-creative other.
This has flattened any hierarchy through movement and enhanced the sense of togetherness and inclusivity in musicking.
