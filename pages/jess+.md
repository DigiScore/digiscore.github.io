## Design (refer to typology [LINK](/typology.md))
**Type:** 10 - *The Living Score* is characterized by the use of intelligent computation systems as a co-creational other inside the flow of 
musicking. There are several approaches to the implementation of computational intelligence within the digital score with each 
offering differing degrees of felt co-operation, presence and autonomy.


## About
*Jess+* is an intelligent digital score system for shared creativity with a mixed ensemble of able-bodied and disabled musicians. 
The digital score uses AI and a robotic arm to enhance the real-time dynamic engagement of the disabled musician with the 
able-bodied musicians allowing her to thrive in a realtime communication beyond what has so far been possible.
AI and robotic technologies are used to extend the crea-tivity of disabled musicians. In a realtime music feedback loop, 
a disabled musician (A) is “plugged into” a creative AI robot arm that draws graphic music notation which is performed 
live by other musicians (B). The creative AI and the disabled musician work as an extended system, with each feeding the other: 
the AI reads the real-time brainwaves and arousal data of the human (A), and (A) feels the embodied behaviour of the robot arm. 
The feed-back loop is closed as the live musicians (B) make sound, which in turn is heard by both the AI and humans (A+B). 
In this system, the AI and the robot arm is not an assistive tool, but rather co-creative other.
This has flattened any hierarchy through movement and enhanced the sense of togetherness and inclusivity in musicking. 


## Analysis (using the 7 modalities - [LINK](/seven_modalities.md))

**Interface Object**

The music idea embedded in *Jess+* is immediately communicated through the visual sense, 
specifically through affectual, empathetic and symbolic *dance* movement of the robotic arm. 
Listening is always present in music-making, and a certain amount of supporting/ secondary material is communicated 
here by this digital score. The immediate phenomenon of experience evoked by this digital score is visual.


**Material Affect**

The sense of being part of a *dance* between the whole ensemble (including the AI/ robot arm) is primarily responsible 
for the affectual connections with the musicians. 
This collective inter-connectivity reaches out and draws in relationships through the following aspects, and in doing so shifts the “sense ratios” 
and “patterns of perception steadily and without any resistance” (McLuhan, 1964):

- 3-D movement of the robot arm (inducing affectual, empathetic and symbolic responses)
- agental persona of the robot arm (a sort of positive and affirming anthropomorphisation welcoming the system into the ensemble as an equal)
- memories and trust embedded into the behaviour of the AI through long-term agile dev process
- autonomus and ensemble behaviours chosen by the AI


**Goal**

The goal of this digital score is to freely interpret the movement of the robot arm as affectual, empathetic and symbolic
instructions with which to respond with a sound. There are two core inspiration points tha underpin such responses which form part 
of a background context:

- first, is the performance practice of interpreting Cardew's graphic score *Treatise* (1963-67)
- second, the performance practice of interpreting Wolff's *For 1, 2, or 3 People* (1964)

As such, the musicians must enter into a metaphorical dance with the ongoing sound they are making as a collective and
being guided by the gestures of the robot arm. The goal is to allow its movements to stimulate a meaningful musical
response within the here-and-now of musicking.


**Content**

The content of *Jess+* is:
- fixed library pre-defined movement gestures
- the balance of behaviour symbolically contained in the AI, between predictable and unpredictable responses
- the speed and acceleration of the robotic arm movements
- the relationships between previous movements and perceived cohesiveness of gestures 
- inked marks on a page (if using pen-mode)


**Language**

There are three modes of interpretation in *Jess+*:

- Iconic - through the fixed gestures developed and embedded into the AI code through agile development and informed by the two inspirations points (see goal)
- Sensory - through empathetic and affectual responses to gestures that could be interpreted as either a musical-conductor (such as those of lead violinist as they coordinate a string quartet), or as a dance-improvisor (responding in realtime to the music, and inspiring musical reactions)
