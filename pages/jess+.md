## Design (refer to typoology [LINK](/typology.md))
**Type:** 8 - *Gesamtkomposition* this uses computers to synchronise multiple streams of media into a cohesive work with live performers (human or machine). It coordinates these through a central software environment that is embedded with autonomous or generative behaviour. This actively composes the work in real-time and evokes the presence of the composer in the flow of musicking.
