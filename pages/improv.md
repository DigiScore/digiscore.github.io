# Improv: a dancing robot 

## Interactive Musical Improvisation Study

## About the study 

Welcome to _Improv_! 

_Improv_ is an AI driven dancing robot designed to listen and respond to you in real time as you engage in musical 
improvisation 

In this study, you will be asked to play a series of short musical improvisations with Improv using one hand on an 
electric piano keyboard, and complete a questionnaire about your experience.  

The purpose of this study is to understand how _Improv_ communicates musical ideas through movement. (_Improv_ follows 
‘Wolff1’, which you may or may not have previously participated in). 

From start to finish, the study should take no longer than 1-hour. 

Please watch the video and read the information below, following the link to sign-up if you would like to participate.

# How will I interact with Improv? 

Positioned facing the keyboard and _Improv_, you will have a chance to practice, and then engage in 6 separate, 3-minute improvisations.  

During these improvisation performances, _Improv_ is listening to you through the mic and designed to cooperate with you as you play music. 

Your task is to explore _Improv_’s capabilities using various musical possibilities of the keyboard in terms of dynamics, pitch, articulation and other expressive features whenever you feel it suits your creative interaction.  

We are interested in your experience of interacting with _Improv_ – you will not be assessed or evaluated on the quality of the music you create. 

# What data will I be providing? 

In terms of physiological data, on your non-dominant hand, you will wear a sensor device to capture your physiological (electro-dermal) activity. During your session, we will ask you to complete a 4-part questionnaire on a laptop (provided): 

- Part 1 – About you:  

    Your age & gender 

- Part 2 – About your musical expertise and experience:   

    Instrument(s) you play, type of musician (performer, composer etc.,), years experience, and pre-conceptions of _Improv_.   

- Part 3 – Improvisation Evaluation(s):  

    After each of the six 3-minute performances, we will record your ratings of specific qualities of interaction with _Improv_, as well as your certainty of those ratings.  

- Part 4 – Session Evaluation  

    After all performances are complete, we will ask you to reflect broadly on your experience with _Improv_ in terms of what felt rewarding, what did not feel rewarding, and how you approached the task.  

    You will have the opportunity to ask additional questions about _Improv_ and the wider project once the study has completed.
