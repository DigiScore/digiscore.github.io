**Interview with Georg Hajdu**

**_Critical Insights_**:

•	Georg integrates his background in molecular biology with his passion for music composition. For him, there's no distinction between his work in science and composition—they are both driven by a deep curiosity about the materiality of the world.

•	He views music as a form of matter, subject to similar laws as those found in biology. His interest in the physicality of music informs his compositional process, which involves exploring the temporal and spectral development of sounds.

•	Generative Music in Healthcare: Georg is currently working on projects that explore the application of generative music algorithms in healthcare settings, particularly in reducing anxiety in hospital waiting areas. By decoding the secrets of soothing sounds, he aims to create music that positively impacts patients' well-being.

•	Composition Process: His compositional process involves a dialectic play between intuition and formalisation. He describes himself as an alchemist, extracting musical elements from various sources and distilling them into compositions.

•	Digital Notation and Tools: Georg developed tools like Macaque, an extension of MaxScore, to realize his compositional ideas. These tools enable him to bridge the gap between intuition and formalisation, empowering both himself and other musicians to explore new musical territories.

•	He explores the theatrical element of music, aiming to create experiences that blur the boundaries between performers and audiences. Through multimedia elements and audience participation, he seeks to establish a sense of community and connectivity.

•	As a composer, Georg wants to provide audiences and people performing his music with an experience of connection to the work and each other.

•	Microtonality and Hybridity: Georg's love for microtonality and hybridity is evident in his exploration of different tunings and scales. He believes in mixing traditional practices with innovative approaches, embracing freedom and letting the listener's ears decide the validity of the music.


**Summary**

Georg Hajdu is a composer and researcher with a background in both music and molecular biology. His interest in biology informs his approach to music, which he sees as a form of matter governed by similar laws. He is particularly interested in the physicality of music and its evolution, drawing parallels between biological evolution and musical development. Currently, he is involved in projects exploring generative music for healthcare settings, aiming to reduce anxiety in hospital waiting areas through the use of specific sounds. Hajdu's compositional approach involves a balance between intuition and formalisation, often using digital tools he has developed to explore musical possibilities. He emphasises the importance of plausibility in music, striving to create experiences that establish a sense of community and connectivity among audiences and performers. Additionally, he is interested in microtonality and hybridity, experimenting with different tunings and scales to push the boundaries of musical expression. Georg Hajdu's work reflects a multidisciplinary approach that integrates science, technology, and artistic exploration.
