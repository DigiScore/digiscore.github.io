# **New Haven University Music Department Lecture**

As the presentation unfolded, different types of tablature scores got the staffs’ attention with some remarks on the prescriptive nature of scores like guitar tablatures and that with those like with traditional scores, one needs to know the song and its context.

Some of our insights on the nature of digital musicianship at New Haven music department:

-there is no requirement for students to know how to read notation on entry into the program, students are required to acquire this skill through their studies

-relationship with scores is difficult for students here – students would be more challenged to respond to a prompt that was not sonic if they had to interpret digital scores.

-most students here identify themselves as music producers, rather than ‘composers’

-the members of staff also remarked that to freely improvise would be challenging for students - they would be able to read a tableture or to improvise in a particular style but would not be aware of the avant-garde improvisation styles and techniques

-if one to start a course on improvisation – they would use text/graphic scores to get students into improvisation with instructions

-here it is a liberal arts program, so students have to take history classes and other arts or media courses which explains why students would be inspired by many different things like books/theories, arts, media, etc. rather than music and other musicians.

-the profs felt if the mentorship is traditional it would be harder for students to take that leap into experimentation with graphic/digital scores, so it takes a figure that students would trust to bring them into that world

-however, it was remarked that if students were to try digital scores, the musical results wouldn’t have to be necessarily avant-garde but could suit the taste/style of students
