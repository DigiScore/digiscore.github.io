# **Columbia University Electronic Music Department Presentation**

This lecture was a consultation/ presentation between the DigiScore team 
and 6 grad students from the Music Department at Columbia University, kindly 
organised by Seth Cluet [http://sethcluett.com/](http://sethcluett.com/).


The discussion involved several grad students with ranging interestes from musicology of ancient score
to computer music performance. As with many grad course, they were involved in teaching UG's in their field.
Their contributed to the discussion was from their own perspectives and representing their impression of the
UG cohorts they teach.


There were two main discussion point, that is also mirrored in the other presentations so far:

1) the traditional music studies divide of performer and composer is no longer representational of the type of activities that these musicians engage with
2) that coding skills (algorithmic thinking, computational creativity, data representation and management, and modern language) is a vital and important attribute in the workplace, and that music studies should engage with it, as it is a perfect platform with which to explore and learn these skills.


Several other key insights were also introduced:
- the digital score, due to its interactivity and open relationships between musicians, is helping move the power balance away from "the composer" (who dicatets) and "the performer" (who obeys). This is very helpful in supporting current concerns of inclusivity and social equality.
- the term digital musician should embrace all musicians who creatively use digital technology in music-making (which thankfully the DigiScore project also supports)
- several sources of inspiration were recalled that could enhance the digiscore project:
  - "Music - Drastic or Gnostic" by Carolyn Abbate
  - Ichiro Fujinaga's researchj into symbolic representations of notation and scores
  - Mariusz Kozak's research on enacting time in embodied musicking expereince.
