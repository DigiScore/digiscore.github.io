<p>Digital Scores</p>



<p><strong>I</strong>nvestigating the technological transformation of the music score</p>



<p>Online form contribution</p>



<p>Participant Information Sheet</p>



<p>Dear Participant</p>



<p>We are inviting you to participate in a research project. An important aspect of this project is the reflection on the nature of digital score musicianship. In order to reflect on this experience, we invite you to complete an online questionnaire. This is part of a series of such activities across the planet. We will be concentrating on 4 key areas:</p>



<p>1. The digital score of the piece – for example, your connections to the materials that form the parts of the digital score (sounds, images, game-worlds). Also, how you formed relationships with the active materials such as pre-recorded melodies, machine intelligence, creative media, evoked music-worlds, or the other musicians.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. The flow in the moment of performing – for example, what journeys were you taken on, how involved in the music you became.&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. Your digital musicianship &#8211; what skills, knowledge, and approaches did you use to facilitate a creative engagement with the piece.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4. Transformative experiences and impact – for example, did the score communicate innovative music ideas, new music experiences, novel compositional approaches, new performance opportunities, music-making engagements, or broader accessibility/ inclusivity for musicians. Has this experience changed your outlook on music-making in general? Will the impact of this experience carry over to other future projects?</p>



<p><strong>What is your role?</strong></p>



<p>Complete an online questionnaire.</p>



<p><strong>Project Outline</strong></p>



<p>The “Digital Scores” project comprises an ambitious programme of practice-based research interwoven with an innovative theoretical investigation into the transformation of the music score being wrought by new computational technologies. A core objective is to investigate the shifts in creativity and musicianship that digital scores have on musicians: composers, performers, makers, designers and coders. A parallel objective is to innovate the music score as an inclusive creative space for musicians of traditional and non-traditional backgrounds. The benefits of the research extend beyond music studies into computer science, new media research and performance practice. It is real “frontier research”, which sits at the intersections of art, technology, cultural studies and creative practice. It investigates new phenomenologies of the experience of digital creativity, and new creative processes in a digital and post-digital world. The PI will lead a collaborative research network across four continents, which will create a series of case studies each addressing new computational technologies such as <em>artificial intelligence, machine learning, virtual reality, gaming, telematic networks </em>and<em> robotics</em>. These are interwoven with a transdisciplinary theoretical study that aims to situate digital scores within the wider fields of digital humanities and media studies. It will engage professional and community musicians, music researchers and students in a longitudinal scientific study of digital musicianship. All aspects of the work will be created and stored in an interactive website which will be publicly accessible. The project will conclude with an academic conference and the publication of two books and numerous articles on digital scores.</p>



<p><strong>What are the objectives of the Digital Scores project?</strong></p>



<p>The objectives of the Digital Score project are to:</p>



<ul>
<li>determine how new computational technologies, integrated as innovative music score systems, can lead to the communication of innovative music ideas, new music experiences, novel compositional approaches, new performance opportunities and music-making engagements, and broader accessibility for musicians of traditional and non-traditional backgrounds.</li>



<li>develop a transdisciplinary theoretical framework that situates digital scores within the wider field of digital humanities and media studies, in order to understand the deep creative experiences of musicking (the act of music-making (Small 1989)) with digital scores built around <em>artificial intelligence, machine learning, internet networking, robotics, virtual and augmented reality, gaming </em>and<em> physical computing</em>.</li>



<li>discover how digital scores stimulate new relationships between musicians and how these profoundly influence the nature of the digital musician.</li>
</ul>
