title: The Starting Point

<p>In 2019 I published my book <em>The Digital Score</em>. In this book, I started a conversation towards understanding how digital technology is transforming our relationships with the notion of the music “score”. I proposed that this transformation could be understood by studying the affect and effect of the multiplicity of relationships that are created between a score, its media, the music, the musicians, the space and the performance, to name but a few.</p>



<p>I set out a simple framework that views these relationships from two distinct perspectives:</p>



<p>• <em>taking-in</em> – in the sense that musicians make connections through the technology as they reach out, suggest, offer and shift with their presence<em>, (AFFECT)</em></p>



<p>• and being<em> taken-into </em>– that the technology can establish a world of creative possibilities for exploration. (EMBODIMENT)</p>



<p>And I asked some very simple questions about what these relationships are, such as:</p>



<ul><li><em>What is taking part?</em> </li><li><em>What is the music-world setting?</em> </li><li><em>How are representations of self and others manifest in this new setting?</em> </li><li><em>How do these relate as journeys of interwoven connections and relationships?</em></li></ul>



<p>From this I built an understanding of a digital score using 7 modes. These are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Interface object </strong>&#8211; identifies the immediate interface of the digital score in order to ascertain the primary sensory input as a basis through which meaning is formed. </li><li><strong>Material affect </strong>&#8211; how the <em>interface object</em> of a digital score evokes meaning through its presence and construction, and to pin-point the affectual connections these create within the musician. </li><li><strong>Goal</strong> &#8211; defines the specific objective that a musician will work towards in the realisation of the digital score. </li><li><strong>Content</strong> &#8211; identifies the direct signals that convey meaning from which the language of a digital score is perceived. </li><li><strong>Language</strong> &#8211; describes the ways musicians interpret their ideas into the signs and symbols that populate the content of their digital score, or the way they receive and interpret such encoded information. </li><li><strong>Feedback</strong> &#8211; identifies the design mechanisms in the digital score that communicate the musician’s on-going involvement with the digital score. </li><li><strong>Flow</strong> &#8211; identify the processes of play and the narratives of experience inside the flow of musicking that stimulate creativity with the digital score.</li></ul>



<p>And grouped digital scores into 10 types, based on significant step changes in these 7 modes:</p>



<ul><li><em>A &#8211; Referential Screen</em> <ul><li>Augmented Page </li><li>Technological Conductor </li><li>Collaborating Score</li></ul></li><li><em>B &#8211; Interactive Systems</em> <ul><li>Animated Score </li><li>System as Score </li><li>Creative System</li></ul></li><li><em>C &#8211; Co-operative Code</em> <ul><li>Performative Code and Hacked Bodies </li><li>Gesamtkomposition </li><li>Networked Ensembles ~ Connected Scores </li><li>Living Score</li></ul></li></ul>



<p></p>



<p>This ERC research grant can now support a much deeper investigation into the nature of the digital score and also to ask the following research questions</p>



<p>•<strong>how digital scores stimulate new relationships between musicians and opens up the possibilities of novel creative experiences; and how these profoundly influence the nature of the digital musician</strong></p>
