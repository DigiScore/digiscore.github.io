**About Point Line Piano**

Point Line Piano is an interactive VR project merging drawing and music, creating a vibrant, multisensory environment. Users draw points and lines in VR, activating musical notes and creating complex visuals. The project aims to stimulate multi-sensory creativity and foster a connection with abstraction. It transforms creativity by integrating composing, performing, and viewing into one experience, allowing everyone to be a composer, performer, and viewer. It supports inclusive music-making, welcoming diverse participants, and plans to become more accessible in the future.

**Objectives**

In this work, Jarek Kapuscinski and OpenEndedGroup’s Paul Kaiser and Marc Downie wanted to explore the potential of the VR environment. This they envisioned through VR as an immersive experience involving music, image, and interactivity, particularly exploring the fusion of image and score in VR environments. Embracing interactivity as a key property of VR, despite previous reservations, they wanted to engage viewers more deeply in the artistic experience. Particularly, their objectives were to integrate music, gesture, and image in a way that mutually informs and influences each other, aiming for a seamless fusion of artistic elements. Another objective was integration of spatial sound in VR to influence the viewer’s experience in the work. Future objectives include incorporating user feedback to adjust and refine the project's direction, including changes to scene structure, musical grids, and user interaction, continuing to explore different formats for audience engagement and interactions through exhibitions and live performances.

**Process**

The journey of creating Point Line Piano began with the desire to further explore the transformative collaborative experiences from previous projects. The decision to merge image and score in VR was inspired by the immersive potential of the medium and its ability to engage the body through gesture and movement. Initial ideas drew from various inspirations such as abstract calligraphies, Chinese ideograms, and Zen script.
The team embraced interactivity in VR, although they had previously avoided it due to concerns about reducing the audience to mere users. They drew inspiration from past interactive installations and sought to redefine engagement with the audience. The project evolved through real-time remote collaboration, coding, and experimentation with music and visuals. Residencies at Stanford and CCRMA provided opportunities to refine the project's structure and explore new ideas. The team experimented with musical layering, scene progression, and spatial sound. Viewer feedback influenced decisions to simplify scenes and give users more control over the experience. The project culminated in a final presentation at ZKM, Karlsruhe, where the team observed unexpected approaches to interaction among viewers. The installation garnered attention not only as an artwork but also as a potential instrument for intermedia concerts.
