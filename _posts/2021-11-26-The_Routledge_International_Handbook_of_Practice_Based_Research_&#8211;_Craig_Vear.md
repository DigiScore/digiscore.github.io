<p><em>The Routledge International Handbook of Practice-Based Research</em>&nbsp;presents a cohesive framework with which to conduct practice-based research or to support, manage and supervise practice-based researchers. It has been written with an inclusive approach, with the intention of presenting deep and meaningful knowledge for the benefit of all readers.</p>



<p>This handbook has been designed to&nbsp;present specific detail of practice-based research by outlining its shared traits with all forms of research and to highlight its core distinguishing features into a cohesive, principled and methodical approach. To this end, the handbook is presented in five sections: 1. Practice-Based Research, 2. Knowledge, 3. Method, 4. The Practice-Based PhD and 5. Practitioner Voices. Each section begins with a leading chapter that outlines each of the distinct areas as they relate to practice-based research. This is followed by a series of contributing chapters that discuss pertinent themes in more detail.</p>



<p>Practitioners from a broad range of backgrounds will find these chapters helpful:</p>



<ul><li>research students or final year graduates will be introduced to the principled nature of practice-based research</li><li>PhD researchers embarking on a research project or are in the flow of research will find this guidance supportive</li><li>professionals such as designers, makers, engineers, artists and creative technologists wishing to strengthen their research into their practice will be guided through the principled and focused nature of practice-based research</li><li>supervisors, managers and policy makers will benefit from the potential and rigour of practice-based researchers in the pursuit of new knowledge.</li></ul>
