**About *Queer Temporal***

The installation-performance digital score explores the disruptive aspects of temporality affecting queer people, focusing on control, precarity, obstacles, and loss. It uses repetition, entropy, and exaggerated sonic and performative elements to manifest these themes. Non-hierarchical collaborative methods are employed in devising performer’s exploration of materials and approaches to time's continuity and discontinuity within an installation-performance. The temporal qualities of sounds are derived from various sources, including audio materials from military and gay liberation marches, and the performer's own recordings. The digital score is communicated through randomised live audio prompts, and an audio installation creating an immersive sonic experience. The performer interprets the materials of the installation by relying on her memory of the archived materials created over a longer period of time while working on this work. These also recall memories of playing marches in different contexts. The piece incorporates clubbing tracks influenced by queer voguing culture and uses transducers on drums to play recorded materials. It introduces obstacles and challenges for the performer to navigate, unfolding organically over one hour with no defined beginning, climax, or conclusion. The performer engages in a dynamic exploration, interacting with instruments associated with military and gay liberation marches, reshaping the narrative of the work.

**Objective**

The objective of this work was to explore the destabilising aspects of temporality for queer artists, focusing on control, precarity, rejection, and overdrive. Musically, the aim was to investigate these topics through repetition, exaggeration, and annihilation of sounding and performing gestures. The project also examined continuity and discontinuity of time, the materiality of sounds, and non-hierarchical collaborative compositional methods. Specific approaches included asking Jennifer to record field recordings based on instructions, interpreting marches, and exploring her relationship with them through memory and gesture. The project involved exchanges on a blog to explore questions and tasks. 

**Process**

This work was developed over 2 years, the exchange and accumulation of the percussion and gestural material was started before DigiScore project began but workshopping and completion of the work was part of the DigiScore project. We exchanged responding to the blogging material which became a platform for exchange, enabling the performer to build connections and make meaning with the materials proposed by the composer. It became a collaborative space where the project's themes were explored and expanded upon. For the work, the composer arranged audio material of the installation and the audio prompts in four categories: 1) march material and playing instructions; 2) gay liberation marches; 3) temporal exploration of material; 4) intimate and social aspects of queer culture.

**Critical Insights from the Analysis**

**_Connectivity_**

•	Performer found meaningful interactions with the materials of the work by closely following the audio score. This process allowed her to immerse in the sonic landscape and deeply connect with the themes and intentions of the work.
•	The performer experimented with a range of gestures, some exaggerated and others opposite to the typical associations with marches. During the performance, the performer delved into the embodiment of these gestures, exploring how they were felt and remembered in the moment.
•	The march, as a symbol of the repetition of normative time and behavior, was a central focus of the project. The performer sought to disrupt this symbolism by infusing the performance with exaggerated gestures, comedic elements and other extra-musical gestures. 
•	The project delved deeply into the relationship between queer identity and space; it explored how queers navigate and utilise space and time to challenge conventional norms and expectations. This exploration was deeply personal and reflective of both composer’s and performer’s own experiences and perspectives.
•	The project utilised an archive of audio and video recordings to create a "memory bank" for the performer. The connectivity between past experiences and present actions in performance was a central theme, highlighting the fluidity and interconnectedness of memory and improvisation.
•	The immersive environment of audio samples allowed the performer to interact with percussion instruments in a dynamic and responsive manner, shaping and changing the space and temporality of the sonic installation in real-time.

_**Flow**_

•	The performer's journey is shaped by her memory and reactions to sonic and percussion materials in space; it is experienced by both the performer and the audience.
•	The duration of the performance is crucial, with a 15-20 minute period of flow being ideal at each entry of the performer into the space
•	The performer's environment and musical impulses influence her experience, and the performer's movement within the space is important.
•	Temporal Explorations: the cyclic nature of the performance could be extended or altered by the performer, potentially changing its feeling of regularity.
•	The performance's form defies norms, with some sections lasting longer than expected.
•	The concept of "installation time" is explored, with repetition that is not identical but also not progressing.
•	The question of time and dramaturgy remains unresolved, with potential for both dramaturgical and non-dramaturgical elements to coexist.
•	However, there may be an underlying dramaturgy that shapes the overall performance.

**_Digital Musicianship_**

•	Performer's agency: the performer has the freedom to reject the score's instructions, an aspect of the project that is crucial for exploring queer themes. 
•	Embodied musical choices: the performer's approach is primarily embodied, with musical and performative choices made through associations and personal connections. This approach emphasizes the physicality and personal interpretation of the performance.
•	Challenges of renewal: one of the challenges is renewing the material, especially when the performer is left alone for extended periods. The need for renewal is essential, but it can be challenging to maintain energy and interest without an audience.
•	Limitations of the performer: the project raises questions about the limitations of the performer, especially when the temporality moves beyond the typical concert time. 
•	To feel artistically alive, performer requires periods of rest and disengagement in the overall presentation of the work.
•	Personal aspect of queerness: the most challenging aspect of the project is the personal aspect of queerness as “performing” queerness can be a slippery slope.
•	Learning through embodied practice: the project provides opportunities for the performer to learn and grow through embodied practice. The performer discovers new possibilities and combinations of sounds and movements that may not have been explored by them before.

**_Transformations_**

•	Open structure: the project challenges the idea of a predetermined form by having a structure that is open, yet contains familiar elements. This allows for a unique and personalized experience for each performance.
•	Learning through performance: the overall work relies on both known and learned percussive and performative movements and gestures. New gestures and performance combinations are learned during the performance, contributing to the ongoing development of the performer's practice.
•	Personal development: the project is important for the performer's development, as it allows her to work with her own queerness on stage. It presents unique challenges and provides an opportunity for reflection on a range of topics rarely experienced in the field.
•	Experimentation with format: the project is an experiment in the format of installation performance, which presents challenges in terms of performance, energy management, and dramaturgy. There is still much to explore in this format, and the piece is expected to continue resonating with the performer in future projects.
•	Stretching boundaries: the performer finds it interesting to be in performance situations that feel like a stretch or present challenges. This project has presented enough challenges to manifest in transformation, contributing to the performer's growth and development.
