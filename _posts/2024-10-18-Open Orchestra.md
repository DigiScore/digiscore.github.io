**_Journey through a Changing World_ for Open Orchestra**

**About the work:**

_Journey through a Changing World_ is an immersive, multi-movement symphonic piece performed by the [Open Orchestra](https://www.openorchestras.org/), an inclusive ensemble composed of participants from two Special Education Needs (SEN) schools in Middlesbrough. The narrative is central to the music, collaboratively crafted by the musicians themselves, allowing their unique experiences and perspectives to shape the performance. Guided by the dynamic, real-time visuals of [Layla Curtis](http://laylacurtis.com/), the narrative of a journey unfolds like a story, with each movement representing a distinct chapter.

•	Movement 1 introduces the beginning of the journey, using footage of arrivals by ship, boat, and plane. The music reflects excitement and anticipation, with the orchestra responding to on-screen action to enhance dynamics. For example, visual cues like footage of a ship signal the bass guitar, double bass, and cello to climb the scale. 

•	Movement 2 explores unpredictability and tension. The drums take the lead, following footage of running through a forest. The pre-composed rhythm is tied to camera movement, with the drums playing when the camera moves and shifting to a steady beat when it pauses. Other orchestra sections are cued through gestures, blending new technology with traditional conducting techniques. 

•	Movement 3 conveys hardship and struggle. Each screen cues a different section of the orchestra, with footage of disused tankers accompanied by booming bass drums. For instance, the piano player begins the next section when chains appear on-screen. The orchestra gradually fades out as other visual elements take over. 

•	Movement 4 concludes with "In the Clouds," evoking tranquility and peace. The pianist follows a middle screen, playing a C major scale in octaves and moving up a note each time a new plane appears. The rest of the orchestra follows changing colors on-screen.

The project seeks to create an engaging experience for both performers and audiences, while also tackling practical challenges such as synchronization. The integration of projection mapping and visual storytelling enhances the music's depth, drawing the audience into the immersive environment. Performers are supported by digital cues that facilitate better synchronization, enabling them to express the narrative more vividly. As the performance unfolds, the interplay between music and visuals deepens the storytelling, inviting everyone present to embark on a shared journey.

**Objectives for the project:**

•	Foster connections between musicians, technology, and the narrative through the use of an integrated digital score.

•	Ensure smooth transitions and natural progression in the performance using visual and narrative cues.

•	Enhance the digital skills of musicians, encouraging innovative uses of technology in orchestral settings.

•	Promote inclusivity, creativity, and audience engagement through immersive and accessible musical experiences.

**Creation Process:**

Ben Hopkinson, music workshop leader of the Open Orchestra project, developed the work through three key stages. In Phase 1 (July 2023), he collaborated with Craig Vear and the DigiScore team to explore and prototype musical ideas using creativity cards. During Phase 2 (October 2023), Hopkinson refined this process by working with music students at a workshop held at Cimarosa Conservatory in Italy, gaining insights into the cards' practical application. Finally, in Phase 3 (October 2023 – July 2024), he collaborated with Open Orchestra students to workshop the piece and create musical and technical solutions that integrated visual elements, temporal coordination, and interactivity for real-time score adjustments. More on this process [here](https://digiscore.github.io/pages/Impact_case_study_Open_Orchestra/).

Hopkinson, alongside the Open Orchestra participants, developed the narrative, with Layla Curtis’ visuals being adapted to align closely with the storyline. Tools like Isadora’s projection mapping software were employed to guide the performers. Technologies such as pulsing colors and wearable devices were incorporated to ensure performers stayed in sync with the music, enhancing both the aesthetic appeal and the functional coherence of the performance.

**Critical insights**

**Connectivity**

•	Digital Integration: The project successfully integrated digital technologies, such as Isadora projection mapping software, Logic Pro X, and the iPad, to synchronize visuals with musical performance, enhancing connectivity between different media.

•	Narrative and Visual Guidance: Visual materials, including original footage edited by Layla Curtis, were used to guide the orchestra through a narrative journey, enhancing the connectivity between the musicians and the storyline.

•	Collaborative Learning: The process involved significant collaboration and the development of new digital skills among the musicians and the composer, fostering a deeper connection between the technological tools and musical expression.

•	Audience Engagement: The use of visual materials and interactive elements, such as projected drone footage of mountains, established a strong connection between the audience, performers, and the narrative.

**Flow**

•	Narrative Structure: _Journey_ was structured as a multi-movement piece, with each movement representing a different chapter of the narrative. This structure helped maintain a natural flow and progression throughout the performance.

•	Visual Cues: The use of projection mapping and other visual aids provided clear cues (e.g., clouds, mountain footage) to the musicians, ensuring smooth transitions and maintaining the flow of the performance.

•	Communication layer: The digital score added a layer of communication, helping musicians, including those with special needs, to follow the music more intuitively and maintain the performance flow.

•	Adjustments and Flexibility: The need for musicians, particularly special needs children, to adapt to the new format indicates a requirement for flexibility in performance. The ability to manage and adapt to these elements was crucial for maintaining an uninterrupted flow throughout the piece.

**Digital Musicianship**

•	Technological Skill Development: The composer and musicians developed new skills in using digital tools like Isadora, Logic Pro X, and the Clarion app, enhancing their digital musicianship.

•	Learning and Application: The composer learned to use tools like projection mapping software, and integrating found materials and live technology into their performances, reflects an enhancement in digital musicianship.

•	Interactive Elements: Incorporating interactive elements like game controllers and iPad apps into the score promoted active participation and skill development in digital music creation.

•	Innovative Instruments: Tools like the Expressive E Touche Midi controller were used to add depth and texture to the music, showcasing the possibilities of digital instruments in orchestral settings.

•	Improvisation and Creativity: The use of found materials and the encouragement of improvisation with students reflect an approach to digital musicianship that values creativity and adaptability. Musicians were prompted to explore new ways of creating music and interacting with technology.

•	Engaging with Complex Systems: The successful application of complex digital systems in Journey required musicians to develop skills in navigating these systems. This included understanding how to use software for real-time manipulation and adapting traditional musicianship to new, technology-driven contexts.

**Transformations**

•	Innovative Musical Experiences: By incorporating visual elements and real-time technology, the project provided a unique musical experience and new opportunities for artistic expression for the musicians involved.

•	Inclusive Practices: The project’s emphasis on inclusivity, particularly through the use of interactive elements and adaptable design for special needs children, highlights a transformative approach to making music more accessible. 

•	Evolving Techniques: The gradual development from initial ideas to more refined performances, as seen through weekly sessions and feedback loops, illustrates the transformative journey of both the project and its participants.

•	Educational Impact: The process of creating and performing Journey was a transformative learning experience for the musicians, inspiring them to discover music in unconventional places and contexts.
