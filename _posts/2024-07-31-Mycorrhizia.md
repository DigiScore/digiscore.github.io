E*xercices d'étrangeté III Mycorrhizia* is an explorative work at the convergence of music, technology, and visual art. Its central feature is a digitally generated score projected onto the floor between musicians, utilising a cloth patterned with a custom mycelium-dye procedure as the projection surface. This visual backdrop symbolises interconnectedness, with musicians wearing vests made from the same cloth. The score's projection metaphorically simulates the exchange of bio-chemical information in mycelial networks using icons derived from mycelium images. These icons move around the space, triggering specific musical gestures and shaping the overall musical form, offering a new approach to ensemble composition where communication and coordination among musicians evolve dynamically. In addition to the main movements, the work incorporates interlude movements featuring large-scale cellular automata simulations of mycelial growth, influencing musicians' improvisation through comprovisation scores. This unpredictability adds spontaneity to the performance, enhancing the immersive experience for both performers and audiences. The potential for the score to become interactive introduces further possibilities, with the mycelial network responding to musical behaviors as if they were external influences, offering avenues for novel forms of interconnected musical growth.


**Objectives**

The core objective was to create a piece where musicians could communicate with each other akin to the exchange of nutrients and chemical signals in mycorrhizal networks. The intention was to develop a metaphorical representation of this natural phenomenon through music. The team aimed to design a digital score and performance environment that felt dynamic and unpredictable, similar to the behavior of mycelial networks. This involved integrating visual projections, wearable costumes, and interactive elements to immerse performers and audiences in a metaphorical mycorrhizal world. The project sought to explore new approaches to ensemble composition where communication and coordination between musicians were not centrally regulated but emerged from mutual interaction and exchange. This involved rethinking conventional notions of scores and performance dynamics. Through collaborative work, the objective was to continuously iterate on ideas, materials, and technologies to achieve the desired artistic vision and functionality.

Ultimately, the work aimed to offer audiences a transformative experience that challenged their perceptions of music, technology, and interconnectedness. By immersing audiences in an evocative mycorrhizal metaphor, the project sought to provoke thought and emotion, fostering a deeper understanding of the natural world through human creativity.


**Process**

The collaborative team, including Sandeep Bhagwati, Alexandra Bachmayer, and Mike Cassidy, worked together to design a digital score that could metaphorically communicate behavior of a mycorrhizal fungi network to performers and audiences. They experimented with various visual and technological elements, aiming to create a living and unpredictable environment that represented mycelial networks. The score projection, made interactive through the musicians' interactions, aimed to challenge traditional notions of ensemble

composition and foster dynamic communication among performers. Throughout the process, the team encountered challenges and made decisions to adapt to practical constraints, such as the need for portability and tourability. They explored different materials, colors, and projections to optimise clarity and communication within the performance space. Additionally, they integrated interlude movements featuring large-scale cellular automata simulations to further immerse performers in the mycorrhizal metaphor.

Despite limitations, such as the inability for the programmed score to react to live sound in real-time, the team considered the performance a prototype, with plans for further development. The collaborative process involved constant dialogue, testing, and refinement, with each member contributing their expertise to shape the final outcome. The work aimed to offer audiences a transformative experience that challenged perceptions of music, technology, and interconnectedness.

**Connectivity**

_***Communication Network***_

· The project represents musicians' interactions as communication through a network, drawing inspiration from mycorrhizal networks where trees exchange information and nutrients.

· A digital score serves as a mediator between musicians and the environment, facilitating their interaction within the simulated network.

· The project draws analogies from biological systems like mycelial growth and cellular automata simulations to simulate connectivity and interaction patterns.

· Complexity emerges from artificial life algorithms like the Primordial Particle System, which govern the behavior of the digital environment and its responsiveness to musicians' actions.

· The project aims to capture the dynamic and unpredictable nature of natural systems, reflecting in the performance's spontaneity and variability.

· The digital environment is generative, creating a new iteration of the score at each performance.

· The project represents the interconnectedness and behaviors found in natural systems, offering a unique perspective on how communication networks operate in both biological and digital realms.

· Eco-friendly materials and organic aesthetics are incorporated, reinforcing the project's thematic connection to nature and sustainability.

***Design considerations***

· The digital score provides musicians with a diverse range of interpretative possibilities, spanning deterministic, generative, symbolic, and abstract directions. This approach enriches the musical experience and opens avenues for creative expression.

· Assigning a limited set of gestures to each movement helps manage cognitive load and facilitates better connectivity by reducing complexity. This ensures that musicians can focus on expressive performance rather than deciphering overly complex instructions.

· The success of the performance hinges on the connectivity of musicians, both technologically and materially.

· The integration of digital projections, custom mycelium-dyed fabrics, and physical costumes fosters a deep sense of connection among performers and with the piece itself.

· The design of the digital score is responsive to the needs and abilities of the musicians. Icons and molecules are carefully crafted to be visually distinct yet meaningful, allowing performers to navigate the score with ease while maintaining engagement and clarity.

***Continuous Feedback Loop***

· The iterative process of developing the digital score involved constant adjustments based on feedback from musicians and the discretion of the composer.

· This feedback loop ensures that the score evolved together with the performers' needs and artistic vision.

***Embodiment and Interaction***

· The use of hand-dyed costumes and a mycelial network enhanced performers' embodiment of the piece, fostering a way of thinking and communicating.

· The physicality of interaction with the score, projected onto fabric, further reinforces the connection between musicians and the music.

***Collaborative Process***

· The development of the digital score involved close collaboration between musicians, composer, and designers. This collaborative effort ensured that the score is not only technically functional but also artistically meaningful and resonant with performers and the audience.

· Immersive Performance Experience: The integration of digital projections, physical costumes, and interactive elements created an immersive performance experience that transcended traditional boundaries between audience and performers. This immersive quality enhances audience engagement and fostered a deeper connection with the music.

**Flow**

· The creative process involved continuous evolution and flux, with constant refinement based on feedback and experimentation. This iterative approach allowed for the exploration of different possibilities and ensured the alignment of musical behaviors with environmental dynamics.

· There was the necessity for extensive preparation for the performers due to the demanding nature of the work.

· The performance demands high levels of engagement and concentration from the performers due to the unpredictable nature of the score. This engagement is further heightened by the dynamic movements and elements within the score, requiring performers to maintain focus and adaptability.

· The digital score environments are categorised into macro and micro approaches. Micro-environments involved rule-based instructions generating specific movements, while macro environments focused on landscape representation.

· The use of comprovisation scores, influenced by the unpredictable behavior and mood of mycelial simulations, suggested a dynamic interplay between the performers and the environment they're responding to.

· Musicians engage with the environmental elements, composing scores that react to the overall environment rather than specific components. This interaction necessitated a deep understanding of the environmental dynamics, influencing the composition and performance of the music.

· Musicians described the score as having a game-like aspect, requiring engagement, concentration, and adaptability. The future interactive nature of the score could add excitement and challenge, enhancing the performers' level of engagement and concentration.

· Contrasts between composed sections and solos provided breaks for performers, offering a shift in focus and cognitive processing. These breaks served to refresh the performers and maintain interest throughout the performance.

**Digital Musicianship**

· The use of generative score shifted the traditional approach to ensemble composition, allowing for decentralised communication and coordination between its creators.
